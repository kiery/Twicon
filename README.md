So the point of this is to make a twitter icon overlay that doesn't make you tweet in order to use it.
We're currently using Paperclip and Image Magick in addition to the default gems. We will also be installing a twitter gem and whatever version of facebook gem exists.
To Do:
* Get images to upload and save
* Add twitter & FB integration
    * Get social media gems
* get user creation/login through social media setup
    * Set up authentication
* Fetch the profile image of a user
* overlay the uploaded image on to the fetched image and create a compound
    * set up image magick
* update the user's profile photo
* create a link to their icon and add it to the gallery
* make the font page a gallery
    * Make it look pretty
* make it so users can add an icon from the front page
* integrate search (make titles mandatory)
